Code 2 hrs a day -> uploaded here

Hey there, 
as you can tell by the line above. I set a goal for myself. I really want to learn to code. But till now i was doing it beside many other things. 
I came to the conclusion if i really want to learn it. It has to be my main focus. So i decided to cut off most of my other activities i did beside coding.
And set the goal to code at least 2 hrs a day on personal projects. Besides that i exercise on freecodecamp and try to get comfortable with solidity.
I want to share my personal projects right here and invite you to follow my journey.

  Today I learned how to compare two Arrays using JSON.stringlify. It was very satisfying.
